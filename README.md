This project was created during the [#WirVsVirus hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) in 2020.

## What is it?

A web platform that helps any vendor or supplier to join forces and deliver essential goods like food under controlled hygienic conditions to customers who are in quarantine during a pandemic.  The basic target process which it enables requires that participating vendors are published in local newspapers and that they accept orders via telephone.

An explanatory video in German can be found at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/BUNZU-Hfax8).

## Exemplary procedure

* Lists of vendors are published in local newspapers and advertising papers, together with times of order acceptance, telephone numbers, and delivery fees.  Source of this data is this web platform.
* Customer in quarantine finds his supermarket and calls at the indicated time and places his order.
* Vendor puts together the delivery, determines availability and price and agrees this again with the customer, offers replacement products if necessary.
* Vendor encloses the invoice with the delivery.
* Vendor creates an entry for the delivery together with a delivery reward in the web platform and gets a delivery number with which he identifies the delivery, which may consist of several parts.
* Vendor selects an available supplier in the web platform or publishes the delivery to subscribing suppliers.
* Supplier receives the offer and accepts it.
* Supplier picks up deliveries from the vendor and delivers them to the customer.
* Supplier places the delivery in front of the house or apartment door and rings the bell.  After the customer took it he marks the success of the delivery via his smartphone in the web platform.
* If a delivery can't be delivered, the supplier returns it to the vendor.
* As soon as the customer has transferred the invoice by direct debit, the vendor transfers the agreed delivery fee to the supplier.
